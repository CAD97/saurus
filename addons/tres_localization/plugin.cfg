name="Resource Localizable String Extraction"
description="Extracts translation strings from serialized resource files (*.res, *.tres).

To extract a string property, annotate it with `@export_custom(PROPERTY_HINT_LOCALIZABLE_STRING)`. The engine uses this to hint that a dictionary property is a map from locale codes to translated strings; we overload it here to hint that a string is intended for display and should be extracted for localization.
